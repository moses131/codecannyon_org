                    <p>Installation is simple and it doesn't take longer than 5 minutes. Upload the script in the directory you want to install SurveyClick. Then visit the link, and you'll see that a form will pop up. From now on, you'll follow the steps and that's it!</p>
                    <h3>Step 1: Requirements check</h3>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="assets/img/img1.png" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    <p>In Step 1 you don't need to do anything. Here you'll be informed about the state of your installed software and extensions. In SurveyClick are only used official PHP extensions: mysqli, json, zip, mbstring, intl, gettext, gd. PHP version accepted: 7.3. MySQL server version 8.0.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 2: Database connection details</h3>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="assets/img/img57.png" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Database, user and password, host. The tables prefix is optional. If you write "myprofix_", the users table for example will become "myprefix_users" instead of just "users". The tables prefix is useful only if you want to use multiple installations in the same database.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 3: Server options & default settings</h3>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="assets/img/img58.png" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    <p>Note*: The following options will be saved as constants in the <i>settings.php</i> file.</p>
                    <p>* Timezone will be used as a fallback if the visitor's country cannot be detected automatically.</p>
                    <p>* Payments will be made in this currency. Accounts balances will be displayed in this currency.</p>

                    <p>For example, you are a software developer and you request in one of the advanced fields the license key. The answer containing the license key will be sent to your app in order to validate it. If it is right, you can save variables such as "purchased product name" (PRODUCT_NAME).</p>
                    <p>You can validate the answer and save some variables. You can throw an error. But you also are able to not throw an error and let the respondent continue the survey without saving any variables.</p>

                    <p>trackingId is a GET parameter that can be passed to a collector URL to save more information about the respondent. Like any other parameter, trackingId can be changed in browser.</p>
                    <p>Example: <u>https://example.org/r/GWXM28?trackingId=test</u></p>
                    <p>We know that for some purposes (like saving an order ID) you need trackingId that cannot be changed or removed. When edit a collector in "Encryption" is a private key that can be used among the trackingId parameter to create a public key. The private key should be used in your app, and not shared with anyone.</p>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="assets/img/img46.png" alt="" />

                    <p>A public key is a MD5 hash that contains encryption key and trackingId. One after another without space.</p>
                    <p>Example in PHP: md5( 'a0cafa5ee25052bb7a29af248d3f3cd5<span style="color:red;">test</span>' )</p>
                    <p>The function will return the public key: 0c2b3f7a58da01d503c2c8ccc7e0e5e5</p>
                    <p>So we have now the final URL for this collector: <u>https://example.org/r/GWXM28?trackingId=test&key=0c2b3f7a58da01d503c2c8ccc7e0e5e5</u> and this will be the message if any of the parameters are changed:</p>
